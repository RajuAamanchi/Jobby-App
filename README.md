Below is a markdown file you can use and customize as README.md for your GitHub repository. It will clearly indicate that your project was bootstrapped using Create React App and instruct users about common scripts, usage, and key linksâ€”structured for clarity and best practices.[1][4][10]

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full control.
