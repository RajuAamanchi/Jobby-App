# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) documentation for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed.

You donâ€™t have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.
